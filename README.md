# Day3-Treasure-Island-Game
Learning control flow and logical operators, i completed a challenge of building a simple Treasure Island Game.
â€¢It was not difficult to understand how Nested If-Else statements works in python, but applying a logic to make computer understand something was difficult...ðŸ’­
â€¢On day 3 i learnt alot about how logical operators works. How to implement logic behind the course...
â€¢It is also important that flow chart plays a big role in breaking down big problems into smaller ones. This method does not only applies in programming but also in a vast area of real life situations...
â€¢Give this small boring game a try and feel free to criticeðŸ˜‰.
â€¢Anyways i hope you like it.
